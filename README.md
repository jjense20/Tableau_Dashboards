# Tableau Dashboards
A collection of **Tableau** dashboards made using the [*Tableau public*](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/) software application on various topics ([*Tableau online*](https://www.tableau.com/products/cloud-bi) is a reasonable substitute that can be used.

## Introduction

The purpose of these projects were to become more familiar with the **Tableau** platform.

## Files & Requirements

There are no pre-requisites for viewing the given *.twbx* files, however if you wish to download any of the files to work or view them I would suggest using [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/) (a free version of the software that can be downloaded locally).
